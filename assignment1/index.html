      <!-- Questions and Answers -->
      <h4>
        1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The initial aspect that caught my attention was the dynamic motion of
        the website. Nearly every element had some form of movement or
        interaction, which immediately created a sense of depth and engagement.
        The main body of text tilts slightly as you scroll, adding a
        parallax-like effect that makes it feel responsive and fluid.
        Additionally, the background video’s 3D movement adds a cinematic
        quality, reinforcing the website’s emphasis on design and interactivity.
        This immediate visual and motion-based engagement suggests that the
        website is designed to feel immersive rather than static, making it
        clear that the creator is showcasing their expertise in UI/UX design.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
        your discrete actions.
      </h4>
      <p>
        During my two-minute interaction, I performed the following actions:
        Observed how the main body text tilts on scroll Noted the 3D movement of
        the background video. Hovered over icons and noticed animations Noticed
        the looping title bar, which added a subtle but effective motion Engaged
        with the custom cursor, which included a unique hover effect and a
        trailing animation. Explored the horizontal scrolling sections, which
        provided a break from the typical vertical flow Each of these
        interactions contributed to a highly responsive and visually engaging
        experience that continuously invited exploration.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h4>
      <p>
        I spent the most time engaging with the main scrolling mechanics on the
        homepage. The way the text and elements responded to scrolling was
        compelling, encouraging me to move back and forth to observe the
        effects. The seamless motion, combined with the layered depth effects,
        made scrolling not just a functional action but an integral part of the
        overall experience. The horizontal scroll sections were also engaging,
        breaking the traditional vertical structure and adding variety to the
        navigation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        4) What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The most common action I performed was scrolling. The website is
        designed in a way that encourages continuous movement, with various
        elements responding dynamically to the user’s input. Whether moving
        vertically or horizontally, the scrolling interactions played a crucial
        role in exploring the content and experiencing the site’s design
        philosophy.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <h4>
        5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
        interactive experience?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The primary goal of the interactive experience appears to be showcasing
        the creator’s technical and artistic capabilities in UX/UI design. The
        website itself serves as a portfolio piece, demonstrating advanced
        interaction design, motion effects, and a unique aesthetic approach.
        Rather than simply listing achievements and work samples, the site
        immerses visitors in a highly stylized and interactive digital space,
        making it clear that the creator is both skilled and innovative in their
        field.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The experience communicates its primary goal through constant
        interactivity, motion design, and visual storytelling. Nearly every
        aspect of the site feels deliberately designed to engage the user,
        showcase technical expertise, and create a memorable experience.
        Additionally, elements like lists of awards and certifications in UX/UI
        design serve as direct proof of the creator’s credibility. The site
        doesn’t just claim expertise—it demonstrates it through execution.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times?)
      </h4>
      <p>
        This experience seems designed for short but highly engaging visits
        rather than extended browsing sessions. A typical user might explore the
        site for a few minutes at a time, interacting with its various elements
        and getting a sense of the designer’s abilities. However, due to its
        interactive and visually rich nature, visitors might return multiple
        times, especially if they are looking for design inspiration or
        considering the creator for a project.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The website’s highly dynamic nature encourages exploration but does not
        provide deep, text-heavy content that requires long reading sessions.
        The continuous movement, unique cursor interactions, and smooth
        scrolling effects suggest that visitors should interact playfully and
        intuitively rather than consuming information in a linear manner.
        Additionally, the minimal navigation structure implies that the
        experience is meant to be short and impactful rather than long and
        exhaustive.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h4>
      <p>The experience references several digital media forms, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Modern UX/UI design trends (such as motion-based interaction and
          microanimations)
        </li>
        <li>
          Interactive art installations, where movement and user input shape the
          experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cinematic design elements, with its 3D video and smooth, flowing
          transitions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gaming UI elements, such as the custom cursor and real-time hover
          effects
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These references suggest that the website is not just a portfolio but an
        artistic and technical showcase inspired by various creative
        disciplines.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The references to modern UI trends, gaming interfaces, and interactive
        art suggest that I should approach this experience with curiosity and a
        willingness to explore. Unlike a traditional website where information
        is consumed passively, this site invites active engagement, requiring me
        to interact with elements, hover over objects, and experiment with
        scrolling to fully appreciate its design.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        feel when engaging with your research experience?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The use of fluid motion, responsive design, and artistic elements
        creates a sense of excitement and immersion. The interactivity
        encourages a feeling of playfulness and exploration, rather than a
        purely informational or transactional experience. This aligns with the
        overall goal of showcasing UX/UI skills in a way that feels modern,
        engaging, and cutting-edge.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h4>
      <p>
        One of the most frustrating aspects of the interaction is the constant
        motion and unconventional navigation. While visually impressive, the
        tilting text, dynamic cursor, and horizontal scrolling sections can
        sometimes feel disorienting or difficult to read. For users who prefer a
        more traditional browsing experience, the high level of interactivity
        might make it harder to quickly access specific information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>
        13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The most satisfying part of the interaction is the seamless scrolling
        experience and fluid motion design. The way elements react to scrolling
        and hovering feels highly polished and intentional, making even simple
        interactions enjoyable. The custom cursor and its trailing effect also
        add a tactile feel to the digital experience, reinforcing the sense that
        this is not just a static website but a carefully crafted interactive
        space.
